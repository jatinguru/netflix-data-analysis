Project Brief:
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to uncover insights related to content trends, genres, release patterns, and production countries. 
Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook analyzes the dataset to identify popular genres, content type distribution (Movies vs. TV Shows),
trends over time, and top actors or directors. The goal is to help stakeholders understand viewer preferences and content strategies through data-driven insights.

Objectives:
1.Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset.
2.Perform descriptive and visual analysis.
3.Identify patterns in content type, release year, genres, and countries.
4.Draw insights about Netflix's content distribution and growth.

Tools and Technologies Used:
1.Jupyter Notebook
2.Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3.Netflix Dataset (CSV)
